## Welcome to Caelum
We are building ecosystems to allow interoperability between organizations in a zero-trust environment.

# caelum
Caelum is a mix of different Blockchain technologies
- Substrate: Governance and Interoperability
- Idspace: container in the cloud with the SSI Process Manager software. One for every organization.

One ecosystem has these elements. Elements have the same internal information in Blockchain but a different level:

- Governor. level = 0
- Trust Agents. level < 5000
- Organizations. level > 5000


## Governor
It’s the root of Authority in the ecosystem. It’s designed to disappear in time when the ecosystem grows to be replaced by community governance.

## Trust Agents
Nodes in the ecosystem with an Idspace. They are organizations with the capacity to add more organizations to the ecosystem.

## Organizations
Nodes in the ecosystem with an Idspace. They are organizations with our Caelum interoperable process manager.
It is also possible to create pools of Organizations inside one Idspace.
